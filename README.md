# Priority-Calculator
The Priority Calculator allows you to allocate your time efficiently, so you can be as efficient as possible.

The Priority Calculator uses 4 Factors that you input into the program to create a schedule that maximizes efficient. The 5 Factors are:

1. Due Date of The Task
2. Difficulty of the Task from 1 to 5
3. Priority of the Tasks from 1 to 5
4. Number of Tasks Inputted
5. Time you have to work

In this program, there is a complex algorithm that maximizes the user's time efficiently no matter the input (difficulty, time, due date, etc.).
A retro gui was also made to be appealing and unique for the user.

Used the python coding language and tkinter to create our creative Priority Calculator Program.
